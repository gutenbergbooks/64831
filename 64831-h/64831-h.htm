in the automotive field. It was here that the modern ignition system
for automobiles and the self-starter were born and the foundation
laid for one of Dayton&rsquo;s most important industries. The barn itself and
one of the 1912 Cadillac cars, first to be commercially equipped with a
self-starter, represent this important invention. Also included in the barn
are several other exhibits which should be of interest to any visitor and
most certainly to every Daytonian.</p>

<p>In industrial production, as in so many other activities, large oaks
from little acorns grow. The cash register and the electric self-starter
are instances in point. The first factory of The National Cash Register
Company under the presidency of John H. Patterson, was a room in
the Callahan Power Building, forty feet wide and eighty feet long, with
thirteen people on the payroll. From it emerged a business on which
the sun never sets.</p>
<p>More humble in environment was the invention of the self-starter
which had its birth in a barn. Almost before a decade passed, it had
made the use of the automobile universal. Such were the beginnings of
two enterprises which, to a degree greater than any others, enhanced
the industrial prestige and prosperity of Dayton. Each contributed a
chapter to the romance of American Industry.</p>
<p>Dayton people, and for that matter, a considerable portion of the
outside world, are familiar with the story of John H. Patterson&rsquo;s industrial
genius that made his name synonymous with cash register production
and distribution. They are not so well acquainted with the origin of
the self-starter and particularly the historic barn in which it was created.
A replica of that barn stands today in Carillon Park.</p>
<p>The Drama of the Barn, as it may well be called, evolved about two
men&mdash;Edward A. Deeds and Charles F. Kettering. Both were born and
reared on the farm, that rugged nursery in which so many of our national
leaders were nurtured; both worked their way through college;
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
both began their careers near the bottom of the ladder at The National
Cash Register Company. Their business alma mater served them well.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

<p class="pcap">The hayloft of the Deeds barn was equipped as a workshop.</p>
</div>
<p>Fate must have decreed that Deeds and Kettering should meet. In
1904 Deeds was Superintendent at the NCR. Electrically minded since
his boyhood on the farm, he had an unwavering confidence in the
application of electricity to industry. At that time the cash register was
operated by turning a crank. Deeds conceived the idea of putting a
motor on the machines to supersede the crank. He designed and built
the first motor to be employed for this use. This is an important link
in the Deeds-Kettering story, because it brought the two men together.</p>
<p>Deeds was absorbed in many responsibilities at the NCR and could
not devote the necessary time to the perfection of the motor. He wanted
a bright young electrical engineer to whom the electrification project
could be entrusted. He asked Alfred D. Cole, his old professor of physics
at Denison University, to suggest a likely candidate. Cole, who had
joined the faculty of Ohio State University, suggested Kettering, his
star student, who was about to graduate. Deeds wrote to Kettering,
offering him a position at $50 a week and the offer was accepted, not,
however, without some qualms on Kettering&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>When Kettering took over his job in the Inventions Division at the
NCR it was to mean more than a brilliant contribution to the development
of the National cash register. It marked the beginning of a kinship
with Deeds that was to make inventive history. The reason for this
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
kinship did not rest solely on the fact that they were both electrically
minded. Also important was the fact that they embodied certain opposites
of talent and temperament which so often make for success.</p>
<p>In 1904, when Deeds and Kettering met, the gasoline-propelled
vehicle, despite jests, jokes and jeers, was becoming a practical reality.
Great inventors like Thomas A. Edison and Charles P. Steinmetz, however,
insisted that it was doomed to failure, contending that electricity
was the one and only effective motive force for the horseless carriage.
Deeds believed otherwise. He saw the internal combustion engine as the
driving power of the future. He had been so impressed with the gasoline
automobile that for a time he had an ambition to go into its production.
Unable to do this, he decided to &ldquo;put something&rdquo;, as he expressed it, on
motor cars. This ambition pointed the way to what became the electric
ignition, lighting, and starting system.</p>
<p>In order to put that &ldquo;something&rdquo; on a car it was necessary to have a
car. Here is where the famous barn first entered the picture. Deeds lived
at 319 Central Avenue in Dayton. Back of the house was a barn which
housed a horse and phaeton. Deeds could easily have purchased an automobile
had he wished. A purchased car, however, would not serve the
purpose that clamored for action. That &ldquo;something&rdquo; could only be
placed on an automobile that he literally knew from the ground up.
With the aid of Fred Schmitt, an expert machinist, he built and
assembled a car which was named &ldquo;Suburban Sixty.&rdquo; All the work on it
was done in the barn. Deeds put a two-speed axle on the barn product
but found that it did not function satisfactorily. He therefore substituted
an auxiliary transmission which did work.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

</div>
<p>Deeds now had a car and the germ of an idea. Once more, absorption
in responsibilities at the NCR prevented him from devoting sufficient
time to the development of the idea. As he pondered over what to do, he
recalled an experience that he had while building the Shredded Wheat
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
plant at Niagara Falls. In order to obtain some equipment for a miniature
electric railway which was to be installed in the factory restaurant,
he was obliged to deal with two men who operated a small manufacturing
firm in Providence. These men sat in an unpretentious office with a
desk between them and operated on a fifty-fifty basis. One ran the
factory; the other looked after business details.</p>

</div>
<p>Deeds and Kettering had often talked of the great things they were
going to do. On one occasion when they sat on a red couch in the living
room of the Deeds residence, Deeds spoke of the two small Providence
manufacturers and their simple plan of ownership and operation. The
inspiration came to him: &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we do the same thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That &ldquo;something&rdquo; on a motor car still clamored for development.
Vaguely, Deeds saw it as an electric ignition system that would emancipate
motorists from one of the tribulations of the early automobile era.
The &ldquo;Suburban Sixty&rdquo; was equipped with an Atwater-Kent single spark
battery ignition. It was efficient but complicated and expensive. Deeds
envisaged improved ignition as another electrical possibility.</p>
<p>Kettering, whose very life was keyed to electricity, had been thinking
along the same line. Deeds had tremendous confidence in Kettering, born
of appreciation of his great gifts which had already registered a solid
achievement at the NCR. He had perfected the motor for the cash
register and had worked miracles on various machines. In Kettering,
Deeds found a heaven-sent associate, animated by the same ideal of
purpose as his own and one who could share his dreams and aspirations.
When Deeds told Kettering of his ideas, he found a willing listener. On
the suggestion that they combine their efforts, the lean, angular inventor
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
needed no urging. He put out his hand, stained by chemicals, and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me. We&rsquo;ll shake on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There and then the Deeds-Kettering partnership came into being,
unsigned but sealed by mutual faith and cemented by loyal friendship.
The informal alliance was fated for an accomplishment that not only
opened up new inventive horizons but contributed to the standardizing
of automobile production and operation.</p>
<p>The first objective was a workshop. &ldquo;Suburban Sixty&rdquo; had been built
in the Deeds barn. Deeds now turned the barn over to the project. The
barn became a laboratory in which ideas flashed and sometimes clashed
back and forth in almost dazzling succession.</p>
<p>Before the curtain rises on the Drama of the Barn let us envisage the
principal actors as they stood on the threshold of the great adventure.
No two men could have presented a greater physical contrast. Deeds
was ruddy, keen-eyed, broad of shoulder; Kettering was tall, spare, and
spectacled. Deeds was the engineer by instinct and training with a flair
for finance and organization. Behind him already lay considerable experience
as an industrial executive. Thus he became the wise counsellor
and negotiator. Kettering was the technical expert with a genius for
invention. To scientific imagination he brought a rare insight into
mechanism. Deeds had once said, in discussing the development of the
electric ignition, lighting, and starting system, &ldquo;Men must hunt in pairs.&rdquo;
For the enterprise now to be initiated, the ideal &ldquo;pair&rdquo; existed. The two
men represented an unbeatable combination.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

</div>
<p>Kettering started work in the barn in the summer of 1908. The equipment
was already installed because Deeds had assembled it for the
production of &ldquo;Suburban Sixty.&rdquo; It consisted of a milling machine, a
drill press, an engine lathe, a tool grinder, a forge, one ten-horsepower
motor, an oscillograph, a long bench, and small tools. All the machinery
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
was concentrated in the hayloft while the &ldquo;Suburban Sixty,&rdquo; the first
guinea pig, rested on the lower floor. Because the equipment was in the
old hayloft, Kettering was dubbed the &ldquo;hayloft inventor.&rdquo; Connecting
the two floors was a narrow, winding stairway on which Kettering
dashed up and down a hundred times a day.</p>

<p class="pcap">Kettering after he started to work on the self-starter.</p>
</div>
<p>In the early period of the project Kettering and Deeds could work
only on weekends, nights, and holidays because they were both employed
at the NCR. In 1909 Kettering realized that if the undertaking was to
get anywhere, it would be necessary for him to devote all his time to it.
He therefore resigned as Chief Inventor and set up shop in the barn,
which was practically his domicile for the next two years.</p>
<p>During Kettering&rsquo;s years at the NCR factory, his chief assistant had
been William A. Chryst, who had risen from office boy to a position of
high skill and responsibility. He became an enthusiastic ally of the
project. Soon he made a third to the duet that plugged away in the barn,
working as a volunteer.</p>
<p>During the period of incubation of ignition, the first link in the electrification
system for the automobile, Deeds largely financed the operation.
Kettering&rsquo;s wants were simple. Deeds and Chryst had their posts
at the NCR. Nevertheless it was hard financial sledding for everybody
concerned. There were many times when the outlook was bleak and the
barn treasury low.</p>
<p>Chryst was the first recruit of the group of men who came to be
known as the &ldquo;Barn Gang.&rdquo; Next came William Anderson. As months
passed they were joined by Zerbe Bradford, William Mooney, John
Reece, Ralph Todd, Harvey I. Phillips, John Lipes, Albert Koffer, John
Sheats, Robert Demaree, and W. G. Johns. These men formed the
nucleus of what later became the Delco organization.</p>
<p>Back in Denison, Professor Cole had often said to Deeds: &ldquo;The
storage battery will come into its own.&rdquo; He transmitted his faith to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Deeds who found an enthusiastic supporter in Kettering. An electric
ignition system stirred their imagination. It was to be part of that
&ldquo;something&rdquo; that Deeds longed to put on a car.</p>
<p>The need of a new and effective ignition system was imperative. For
years motorists had struggled with the magneto apparatus which was
a prize producer of headaches and backaches. On a magneto it was
not possible to run slow in high gear in heavy city traffic without risk
of stalling which, when it did occur, meant hopping out of the car and
cranking up. To crank a car on a magneto when the dry batteries on
the auxiliary system had run down, demanded a considerable amount
of endurance. It prevented the women motorists from driving alone.</p>
<p>The system that created many of these complications was equipped
with a magneto and an auxiliary vibrating coil dry battery. The basic
trouble was that it produced an insufficient amount of current. Hence
the frequent stalling. What Kettering did in that long ordeal in the
barn was to change from a vibrating system to a single spark which
conserved the battery and produced ample electric power for ignition.
The vibrators, which demanded endless tinkering every time a car was
taken out for use, vanished from the spark coils. Kettering&rsquo;s dictum
was: &ldquo;No spark outside the cylinder but a good one inside.&rdquo; To prove
the efficiency of the electric ignition system, Deeds, accompanied by
Mrs. Deeds, drove to New York and back on one set of dry batteries,
which were still not exhausted when the car arrived back in Dayton.</p>
<p>With the electric ignition complete, the big question was to whom
it should be submitted. It was not a difficult problem once the motor
manufacturing field was surveyed. At the head of the list of producers
was Henry M. Leland, whose name had become synonymous with
Cadillac. &ldquo;Uncle Henry,&rdquo; as Leland was affectionately known, was
the Grand Old Man of the automobile industry. It was a tradition in
the business that &ldquo;if you can satisfy &lsquo;Uncle Henry&rsquo; you can meet the
highest and most exacting requirements.&rdquo; He was an engineer of international
reputation and the Cadillac was the apple of his eye.</p>
<p>As was the case with every other automobile manufacturer, Leland
was fed up with the magneto ignition. When the barn product was
brought to his attention he was interested. Chief Engineer Sweet of
the Cadillac Company came to Dayton to investigate. Deeds and
Kettering met him at the railway station and took him for a ride
in Kettering&rsquo;s Cadillac roadster which was equipped with the new
electric ignition. They covered miles of Dayton streets and more miles
of rough country roads adjacent. Then they landed Sweet safely at
the station. When they tried to start up the car after his departure,
the system stalled. A wire had broken in cooling off and fell apart. If
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the system had broken down while Sweet was aboard the car, events
might have turned out differently.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="632" />
<p class="pcap">A scene duplicated many times&mdash;W. A. Chryst and C. F. Kettering
&ldquo;trying it out&rdquo; on an actual run.</p>
</div>
<p>When an ignition set was sent to Detroit, Leland shared Sweet&rsquo;s favorable
impression. Negotiations for a contract now began by correspondence.
The great day came when Mr. and Mrs. Deeds and
Kettering went to Detroit for the signing of the contract. Leland was
immensely taken with the two eager, earnest young men who walked
into his office that autumn day in 1909. The deal was threshed out in
a discussion that lasted for some hours. Then a contract was signed
for 5,000 ignition sets.</p>
<p>Now developed something of a dilemma. Deeds and Kettering had
no firm name, in fact no formal business association at all. The contract
therefore was made out in Deeds&rsquo; name. Deeds and Kettering
started off from the Cadillac plant in a borrowed car. Soon after they
got under way it was discovered that the precious contract was in
Kettering&rsquo;s pocket. Taking it out he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the danged
thing. You keep it.&rdquo; With this he handed it over to Deeds. Soon he
left the car and Deeds proceeded to the home of an old friend where
Mrs. Deeds was anxiously awaiting the outcome of the negotiations.
In his full and fruitful life Deeds was to know many precious hours.
But no moment was sweeter than when he handed the contract to his
devoted companion of the years with the words, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s signed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cadillac contract presented another problem for Deeds and
Kettering because they had no plant. Their original idea in uniting
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
for the barn project was to develop what Kettering called an &ldquo;idea
hatchery.&rdquo; Production had never been considered. The problem was
soon solved. While working during vacations for the Star Telephone
Company of Ashland, Ohio, Kettering had had some dealings with the
Kellogg Switch-Board and Supply Company of Chicago. He got in
touch with them and they agreed to manufacture the sets.</p>
<p>Deeds and Kettering now had a contract, a commercial product, and
a firm to make it. The next step was to organize a corporation with a
striking name. Deeds suggested The Dayton Laboratories and Engineering
Company. When Kettering asked Chryst what he thought
of it, he got this reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good. Why don&rsquo;t you change the words around and call it
The Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company?&rdquo; This time Kettering
was unimpressed. But Chryst&rsquo;s suggestion prevailed and the company
was incorporated July 22, 1909. Remembering the experience of the
two small Providence manufacturers, Deeds projected the company on a
fifty-fifty basis with a capital stock of $150,000, two-thirds of which
was common stock. The shares were equally divided between the two
men. Each was a joint owner with the other in all contracts and patents.
Deeds became President and Kettering Vice President. With incorporation,
a modest office was opened in the United Brethren Building on
Main Street with a staff consisting of one man who was clerk, bookkeeper,
secretary, and general factotum.</p>
<p>Chryst had succeeded Kettering in the NCR Inventions Division, but
spent every moment of his spare time at the barn. He was immensely
proud of his choice of the company name. As he worked about
the barn he began to refer to it as &ldquo;Delco.&rdquo; Soon Deeds, Kettering
and the rest of the &ldquo;Barn Gang&rdquo; took it up. In this way the name that
became a household word came into being.</p>
<p>Then trouble broke. Soon after the first ignition sets had been delivered
to Cadillac, Kettering received a telegram from Leland saying
that the controlling relays, the heart of the ignition system, were sticking.
&ldquo;Come at once&rdquo; was Leland&rsquo;s command. Kettering was certain
that the specifications given to the Kellogg Company were accurate.
He went to Detroit, tried out the system, and sure enough the controlling
relays stuck. Leland had announced that the new ignition
system would be placed on his 1910 car. He prided himself on the
integrity of his word. It was up to the &ldquo;hayloft wizard&rdquo; to make good.</p>
<p>Kettering put the relays in his bag and took the midnight train back
to Dayton. The next twenty-four hours would be crucial for Delco.
As sleep evaded him he reached into his bag, got out one of the relays,
and began to feel the pole pieces and the armature. Then, in the darkness
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of his upper berth, he discovered what was wrong. The Kellogg
people had made the pole pieces a trifle rounded instead of perfectly
flat. Kettering went straight to the barn from the railway station,
machined the pole pieces down, and returned to Detroit on the next
train with one source of trouble ended. Another anxiety developed
when there was coil trouble. Again Kettering dashed to Detroit and
worked a miracle.</p>
<p>The spark ignition, with the slogan, &ldquo;Nothing on the dashboard but
the switch,&rdquo; went on the 1910 Cadillac and operated to the satisfaction
of every user. A new cycle of the Motor Age dawned. Delco was
launched.</p>
<p>A trouble far more serious than mechanical anxieties now developed.
In his almost vicious assault on the barn problems, Kettering strained
his eyesight. It augmented a weakness that had started in his college
days when he burned the midnight oil. For a time it was feared that
his vision would be permanently impaired. Despite this handicap he
stuck resolutely to the job.</p>
<p>When the ignition contract was signed with Cadillac there were
308,930 automobiles and 6,030 trucks in the United States. These totals
represented a tremendous advance from the day when it was a debated
question as to whether the horseless carriage would be propelled by
steam, electricity, or gasoline. Gasoline had won out and the internal
combustion engine came into its own.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="705" />
<p class="pcap">Another view of the hayloft workshop, W. A. Chryst with back to camera.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the automobile had &ldquo;arrived&rdquo; it still labored under a serious
handicap. It was necessary to crank a car by hand in order to start
it. Often it was a back-breaking and sometimes an arm-breaking operation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
The crank still made the motor car something of a butt for cartoonists
and jokesters.</p>
<p>Once more, Leland stepped into the Delco picture. Like every other
automobile manufacturer, he had a grievance against the crank. One
day he picked up his friend, Carter, while driving to the Cadillac plant.
On the Belle Isle bridge the car stalled. Carter got out to crank it; the
engine kicked back and broke his arm.</p>
<p>Leland sent for Kettering and told him of the Carter mishap. Then
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crank is vicious, turbulent and unruly. I am breaking arms
all over the country and it&rsquo;s got to stop. In the past six months six of
my workmen have fractured their arms while cranking cars. What
can be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kettering replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that it would not be difficult to crank a car by electricity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always alert for improvement and never hesitating to do pioneering,
Leland said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can provide an electric starter, I will put it on my 1912 car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing particularly new about the self-starter as such.
There were starters that operated by a coiled spring, and starters that
used gas or compressed air. None of them, however, had come into
anything like wide and satisfactory use. Electricity had turned the trick
for ignition; Kettering was certain it could repeat the performance for
a self-starter.</p>
<p>Kettering returned to Dayton and on the same train with him went
a new Cadillac engine. Both were in the barn before day dawned.
Deeds appeared to lend a hand. They rousted out an implement maker,
got him to send over sprocket wheels and chains, and rigged a temporary
set-up with motor and storage batteries. Now came the great
question, &ldquo;Can we do it electrically? Will it turn the engine over?&rdquo;
The &ldquo;Barn Gang&rdquo; worked all day, Deeds calm and imperturbable; Kettering
with his customary dynamic energy. Late in the afternoon Kettering
said, &ldquo;I wonder if the danged thing will work,&rdquo; to which Deeds
replied, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The connection was made and the engine turned over. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; as
Deeds commented later on, &ldquo;we knew that quantitatively it was practical.&rdquo;
It was a memorable hour, for in the gathering dusk was born
the second of the barn products that put the cap-stone on motoring,
and made it safe as well as useful. With the perfection of the electric
self-starter, a woman, even a child, could get into a car knowing that
by merely pressing a button, the machine would start. It meant farewell
to arm- and back-breaking. Gone was the crank and gone, too, was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
acetylene tank of compressed gas for the headlights. The electric lighting
of automobiles came simultaneously with the self-starter.</p>
<p>Convinced from his tests of sample sets that the electric self-starter
was practical, Leland announced that the new device would go on his
1912 car. It was now late in 1910. Time again was of the essence for
work in the barn, and time was beginning to run out. As with ignition,
trouble came. When the new Cadillac car arrived at the barn it was discovered
that the engineers at Detroit had not left sufficient room for the
self-starter. This meant new drawings and new designs. With this obstacle
hurdled, disaster broke. While driving on a stretch of bad road between
Dayton and Xenia, Kettering&rsquo;s car slid into a ditch. The impact not
only smashed the car but broke one of his ankles. The foot was put into
a cast and Kettering was ordered to remain in bed for two weeks.</p>
<p>On the morning after the accident a telegram from Detroit brought
the news that the only Cadillac car equipped with one of the electric
self-starters had caught fire in Leland&rsquo;s garage. The starter was badly
damaged. Within twenty-four hours Kettering was under that car, his
crutches on the ground alongside, and his cast-bound leg sticking out
from beneath the chassis. He brought the bruised and blackened starter
back to life and action.</p>
<p>Now developed a new source of anxiety. Battery manufacturers,
cautious and skeptical, maintained that no electric storage battery could
be produced that would meet the requirements imposed. Delco needed
thousands of batteries. In their dilemma a new ally came to their aid.
He was O. Lee Harrison, salesman for the Electric Storage and Battery
Company of Philadelphia, one of the largest concerns of its kind in the
country.</p>
<p>He worked out of the Cleveland branch and while at Steubenville,
Ohio he received this wire from the manager:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a letter from the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company
signed by a man named Kettering who wants to buy 5,000 storage
batteries. Go down and see what he looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harrison went to the little Delco office in the United Brethren Building.
Wearing an old golf cap, Kettering was seated in a swivel chair with
his feet propped up on the top of a desk. To him Harrison said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking for a man named Kettering who wants to buy 5,000
storage batteries. I don&rsquo;t expect to sell him but I want to see what he
looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man at the desk dropped his feet to the floor and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Kettering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kettering took Harrison to the barn and showed him the self-starter.
In its original form it had sprockets and wheels and looked like a
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
McCormick binder. When Harrison said it reminded him of the farm,
Kettering remarked that he, too, was a farm boy. From that moment
the two men clicked. Harrison went to Philadelphia and urged the sale
of 5,000 batteries. When the President of the company asked about
Delco credit Harrison responded that they had no rating at all but
that &ldquo;they had something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upshot was that Harrison had two batteries made to meet Delco
needs. One was a twelve-cell weighing sixty-five pounds. When he
showed it to Kettering he was told that it was too big. Harrison went
back to Philadelphia and asked for lighter ones. By this time his employers
were fed up with his enthusiasm for the self-starter and decided
to wash their hands of the whole business. Then Harrison played his
trump card. He told the head of his concern that if he did not fill the
Delco order he would go over to its strongest competitor. This threat
carried the day. With his own hands Harrison perfected a light battery
that met Delco needs. Before long Harrison was devoting part of his
time to Delco interests. Eventually he became a valued part of the
organization.</p>
<p>The battery problem was now solved but another difficulty arose. The
new and lighter batteries had to be installed and this required time.
Meanwhile time was slipping. Leland telegraphed that he was going to
Bermuda on a vacation. If the electric self-starter was to go on the 1912
Cadillac, he must test it himself before he sailed. Only three more days
remained before the deadline.</p>

<p class="pcap">To prove the sturdy qualities of the self-starter, races were run
in which the starter itself was the only motive power allowed.</p>
</div>
<p>When the completed self-starter seemed ready to be shipped to
Detroit something went wrong. For two days and nights Kettering and
the &ldquo;Barn Gang&rdquo; labored to find the source of the trouble. If the starter
did not reach Detroit in forty-eight hours, all was lost. Still the trouble
persisted. Finally, late in the afternoon, Kettering sent an S.O.S. to
Chryst who was still at the NCR. When he arrived at the barn all he
could see of human life was legs protruding from under Kettering&rsquo;s car
which was now the guinea pig. The gang was completely exhausted
after the long ordeal of heat, toil, and trouble. &ldquo;You fellows rest
awhile,&rdquo; said Chryst, &ldquo;I will try to find out what is wrong.&rdquo; Wearily
Kettering and Anderson hauled themselves out from under the car and
before Chryst could say another word fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>Chryst took out the starter mechanism and found that two wires
were wrongly connected. In their utter exhaustion Kettering and
Anderson had not discovered it. Chryst fixed the wires in short order.
The self-starter, now complete, went to Leland by express that night.
Once on the 1912 Cadillac, every expectation was realized.</p>
<p>The experimental shop in the barn&mdash;the setting of so many headaches&mdash;now
gave way to a factory. Quarters were rented on the second floor
of the Beaver Power Building at the corner of Fourth and St. Clair
Streets. Delco was now a full-fledged and going concern. The advent
of the self-starter however required money and machinery. Deeds and
Kettering had little of either. With implicit faith in the enterprise, they
mortgaged their homes and borrowed money on their life insurance to
raise the wherewithal for equipment. In the same year that the self-starter
went on the Cadillac, Delco engaged the entire new four-story
Beaver Power Building then nearing completion. When Deeds signed
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the lease, Fred Beaver, owner of the building, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys will never fill this building making self-starters.&rdquo; To this
Deeds replied: &ldquo;Just watch us grow.&rdquo; And grow they did. The second
Delco order to O. Lee Harrison was for 15,000 storage batteries, the
largest placed up to that time. An enterprise that began in a barn with
scant assets save the faith, energy, and inventive genius of the founders,
had created an industry whose name carried weight wherever automobiles
were made.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="629" />
<p class="pcap">Some of the first self-starters manufactured by the newly formed Delco.</p>
</div>
<p>Ultimately Delco became part of the vast and far-flung General
Motors organization which progressively brought new industries and
with them expanded employment to Dayton. The small acorn, planted
in the barn, had sprouted to giant proportions.</p>
<p>The business arrangement with Leland developed into a strong and
lasting friendship. Father and sons could have had no deeper regard
for each other than the dean of motordom and the two young men who
had made Delco possible. So satisfactory was the relationship between
them that the contract for the ignition system was their first and last.
Subsequent dealings involving many millions of dollars were arranged
by telephone, telegraph, or orally.</p>
<p>This relationship had an interesting and, so far as the automobile
industry is concerned, an historic sequel. Although the episode did not
transpire in the barn it was a direct result of all that happened there.
As such it is well worth relating.</p>
<p>As Delco grew in prestige and prosperity Deeds and Kettering purchased
between them a tract of beautiful rolling country just outside
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Dayton. Each built a residence on his property. Deeds called his place
Moraine Farm because all the hills around Dayton are terminal
moraines. One of the first features he installed was a model dairy where
the milking was done by electricity. Part of the dairy became the
setting of an experiment that re-enforced motor car equipment. The
Delco electric ignition, lighting, and starting system had been born in a
barn. The Cadillac V-8 was perfected in a cow shed.</p>
<p>The first Delco system had been put on a four-cylinder car. In 1914
some of the large automobile manufacturers advertised that they would
produce a six-cylinder car. Leland at once announced that Cadillac
would never make a six-cylinder car and gave it wide publicity.</p>
<p>Deeds learned that Leland&rsquo;s plan to meet the six-cylinder car competition
was to put a two-speed rear axle on his four-cylinder car.
Deeds, as you will recall, had installed a two-speed rear axle on his
&ldquo;Suburban Sixty&rdquo; and found it wanting. He realized that with such an
arrangement Leland would trail in the parade of high-powered cars.
Deeds and Kettering viewed the situation with concern so they decided
to do something about it. If Leland&rsquo;s competitors were to have a six-cylinder
car, why should he not have an eight-cylinder car? At that time
an 8-cylinder car was undreamed of so far as American production
was concerned. The idea was revolutionary, but Deeds and Kettering
had always done the revolutionary. They now set about doing it again.</p>
<p>The first V-8 car seen in this country was a French De Dion which
was exhibited at the New York Automobile Show. Deeds and Kettering
purchased it and had it shipped out to Moraine Farm. They found it
clumsy and unsuitable for study or adaptation. If Leland had ever seen
it he would never have fallen in with the suggestion for a Cadillac V-8.</p>
<p>Deeds cast about for a suitable experimental engine. He knew that
E. J. Hall of the Hall-Scott Motor Company in California&mdash;the same
Hall who was destined to have such an important part in the designing
of the Liberty engine&mdash;had built an eight-cylinder aeroplane engine
and installed it in a chassis. Perhaps this might serve the purpose. Deeds
wired Hall to send it by express. &ldquo;Do you mean express?&rdquo; wired Hall
in reply. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Deeds.</p>
<p>The engine and chassis were shipped to Cincinnati where Kettering
and Chryst, who was now a part of the Delco organization, picked it
up. They drove it to Dayton, arriving in the early hours of the morning
wet, cold, and mud-splattered. The engine was put on a Stevens-Duryea
car owned by Kettering. It was christened &ldquo;Old Steve&rdquo; and became
a guinea pig to rank in motor car history with &ldquo;Suburban Sixty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>

<p class="pcap">Almost 40 years after the invention
of the self-starter,
Kettering and Deeds sit across
from each other at the old desk
which they formerly shared. The
occasion was &ldquo;Deeds Day&rdquo; at
Denison University, where this
desk is now preserved.</p>
</div>
<p>Detroit is a rumor factory. If the work had been carried on there, the
whole city would have known about it. It was therefore necessary to
carry out the experiments in Dayton and in secrecy. Deeds turned the
cows out of his barn and used it as a machine shop. All the machinery
was installed at night and most of the work was done while Dayton
slept. The secret was well kept. Deeds and Kettering improved the Hall
engine and then took &ldquo;Old Steve&rdquo; to Toledo, where Leland gave it a
drastic tryout. It stood up under every test, proving that the V-8 principle
was right.</p>
<p>Leland now entered enthusiastically into preparations for his Cadillac
V-8. Secrecy was still necessary. He therefore rented a shop in
Worcester, Massachusetts, and brought over D. McCall White who had
built the British Napier Eight to design the car. White did his work
well. In 1914 the Cadillac V-8 was launched with proper eclat, enhancing
the prestige of American-made automobiles.</p>

<p>If Deeds and Kettering had not carried out their experiments in
the cow barn at Moraine Farm, the Cadillac V-8 might never have
come into existence. Certainly it would have been long delayed. It was
a labor of love on the part of Deeds and Kettering in gratitude for what
Leland had done for them when Delco was little more than an inspiration.
They never accepted a cent of compensation.</p>
<p>The Delco achievement stands as a thing apart in the development
of American productive enterprise. It created a new industry, revolutionized
the use of the automobile, and launched Deeds and Kettering
on the road to wider and equally constructive fields. One became an
outstanding industrial leader and builder; the other rose to be the
greatest industrial scientist of his time.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p10b.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="637" />
<p class="pcap">The Liberty engine, a milestone in the development of American aviation, is among
the historic exhibits in Deeds Barn.</p>
</div>
<p>The Liberty Engine, one of the outstanding achievements of World
War I, represents an engineering and manufacturing triumph that
contributed much to man&rsquo;s mastery of the air.</p>
<p>Conceived in less than six weeks during a time of crisis, it was the
finest aircraft power plant of its time, and for a decade thereafter
remained the nucleus around which aerial advances were made.</p>
<p>The story of the Liberty engine begins in 1917, shortly after the United
States entered World War I. Air power, even then, had become a vital
factor in military operations, and the hard-pressed Allies desperately
needed a quantity-produced aircraft engine that would wrest control
of the skies from the Central Powers. They turned to the United States
and its industrial might for a solution to this critical problem.</p>
<p>How productive this appeal was to be was borne out in the events
that followed. At the direction of Colonel Deeds, who was then serving
as Chief of Aircraft Procurement, two automotive engineers literally
locked themselves in a Washington hotel room and went to work. The
date was May 29, 1917.</p>
<p>Colonel Deeds&rsquo; instructions had been brief but to the point. He cautioned
the engineers, J. G. Vincent and E. J. Hall, that the engine they
designed had to be light in weight in proportion to power, and adaptable
to mass production. Then he added a final admonition: the engine
must embody no device that had not already been tested and proved in
existing engines. There was no time for experimentation.</p>
<p>Within forty-eight hours Vincent and Hall had come up with the
rough design of the engine. Three days later they had incorporated in
the design all of its major features, and shortly thereafter the nation&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
auto manufacturers had started production of parts for five 8-cylinder
engines and five 12-cylinder engines.</p>
<p>Deeds had been shooting for completion of the first trial engine by
July 4. This goal, which seemed to many the strongest form of wishful
thinking, was more than met in what will remain as one of the classic
achievements in American production annals. Impossible as it had
seemed, a complete 8-cylinder engine was delivered to the nation&rsquo;s
Capital on July 3, a day before the deadline and less than six weeks
after the design was drawn. The first 12-cylinder engine passed its tests
the following month.</p>
<p>In the short span of a year from the date when its designers first met,
1,100 Liberty engines had been produced and put into service. By the
time the Armistice was signed, 24,475 engines had been turned out and
daily production of the V-12 had climbed to the staggering figure of
150 every 24 hours. The magnitude of this engineering, manufacturing
and management feat is pointed up by the fact that a host of small jigs,
tools and fixtures were required to build every part of the complicated
engine.</p>
<p>Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, said of the project: &ldquo;I regard
the invention and rapid development of this engine as one of the really
big accomplishments of the United States since its entry into the war....
The story of the production of this engine is a remarkable one.
Probably the war has produced no greater achievement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the Liberty engine became a potent factor in World War I,
its greatest achievements were to come in the years following, when for
the first time aviation&rsquo;s horizon was lifted above the level of county-fair
stunt exhibitions and the foundation laid for commercial aviation.</p>
<p>It was the Liberty engine that first enabled man to conquer the ocean
in an airplane. Four of the 440-horsepower engines powered the famous
U. S. Navy NC-4, which in 1919 became the first plane to fly the
Atlantic.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Martin MB-2 was used by General Mitchell in the 1921 tests which indicated
the destructive ability of big bombing planes. Liberty engines supplied the power.</p>
</div>
<p>Two years later, when General &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Mitchell conducted his historic
and dramatic demonstration of the potency of air power, Liberty-powered
planes were called upon to do the job. The big bombers, as
Mitchell had predicted, sank a 22,000-ton German battleship in only
twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p>In April, 1923, the Liberty was again in the headlines. Two Army
pilots, Lieutenants Oakley Kelly and John Macready, flying a Fokker
airplane powered with a Liberty engine, stayed aloft for thirty-six consecutive
hours, shattering all previous endurance marks. Later the same
year they completed the first non-stop transcontinental flight, again
using the Liberty-powered Fokker.</p>
<p>The following year still another achievement was added to the Liberty&rsquo;s
long series of successes. Two Douglas Cruisers, powered with
Liberty engines and prepared for the flight at Dayton&rsquo;s old McCook
Field, became the first planes to circle the globe, covering 26,345 miles
in 363 hours of actual flying time.</p>

one of which is shown above. There again, the Liberty engine helped establish
a memorable record in aviation history.</p>

<p>Besides holding at one time the world&rsquo;s speed and altitude records,
the Liberty also was the engine that first made the concept of air-mail
service more than just a dream. Charles A. Lindbergh was among the
pioneer pilots of the early 1920&rsquo;s who flew Liberty-powered De Haviland
mail planes along relatively uncharted air lanes through all types of
weather.</p>
<p>Thus, the war-born Liberty became the cornerstone of American
commercial aviation and the forerunner of today&rsquo;s vast and complex
network of aerial transit. Years ahead of its time, the Liberty engine
stands today as an outstanding example of American productive genius.
Born in time of war, it played an important role in time of peace. In
aviation&rsquo;s hall of fame, the Liberty engine is assured a place of honor
for decades to come.</p>

Deeds&rsquo; specifications. While it was never used for long ocean voyages,
it was fully capable of making them. The &ldquo;Lotosland&rdquo; included many
innovations, one of the most important of which was the amphibian
airplane which it carried. She was the first ship, other than a naval
vessel, to be so equipped. When the United States entered World War II,
the Navy requisitioned the &ldquo;Lotosland&rdquo; and converted her into a combat
ship for anti-submarine patrol. She made a distinguished war record
and accounted for at least one submarine. After the war the &ldquo;Lotosland&rdquo;

part of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio system.</p>
</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Cincinnati,&rdquo; prototype of the replica in miniature on display in
Deeds Barn, was typical of the locomotives that in the 1850&rsquo;s were
beginning to establish a new transportation network across Ohio and
the Middle West.</p>
<p>These locomotives and their successors were to doom the canal system
which played such an important role in development of the West.
Although the Miami and Erie Canal&mdash;which linked Dayton to Cincinnati
and Toledo&mdash;had its peak year in 1851 when the &ldquo;Cincinnati&rdquo;
first steamed into Dayton, canal operating expenses outran revenue
only five years later. In 1877, official operation of the canal ended.
In the march of progress, the railroad had won.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cincinnati&rdquo; was built by the Harkness firm of Cincinnati, and
was one of the most advanced locomotives of its day. Its honest
functionalism, as evidenced by the businesslike cow-catcher and the
monstrous stack designed to trap dangerous wood sparks, makes this
type of locomotive, called an &ldquo;American,&rdquo; a favorite with railroad fans.</p>
<p>How long the &ldquo;Cincinnati&rdquo; remained in service with the C.H.H.&amp;H.D.
Railroad, and its ultimate fate are not known, but the colorful locomotive
and others of its kind made possible significant gains in man&rsquo;s

<p class="pcap">Display of the 20,000 parts which make up a modern National Accounting
Machine, outgrowth of the early cash register.</p>
</div>
<p>Inasmuch as C. F. Kettering and E. A. Deeds began their careers
with The National Cash Register Company, it seemed fitting that some
representation of that company&rsquo;s products should be included in the
barn display. The display includes early models of National cash registers
and an impressive exhibit of the 20,000 parts which go to make up
a modern National accounting machine.</p>
<p>The cycle of events moves in unpredictable and often unexpected ways.
When E. A. Deeds left NCR to help develop the self-starter business, he
probably never expected to be a part of that organization again. Yet
in 1931 he was named Chairman of the Board of that company and
subsequently played an important part in its very considerable development.</p>
<p>When Deeds and Kettering first went with NCR, the line of machines
which made up the company&rsquo;s products was limited indeed. It
was they who took the first steps toward an electrically operated cash
register. The possible entrance of the company into the accounting machine
field had not even been considered. Employment at the local plant
was about 2,400 people.</p>
<p>Today The National Cash Register Company derives almost as much
of its business from the sale of accounting machines as from the sale of
cash registers. Through continuous research and advanced engineering,
it has created machines which meet the needs of business wherever
money is handled or records are kept.</p>
<p>The Company now employs 13,000 people at the Dayton plant. With
complete accuracy, the cash register bell is often referred to as &ldquo;The
Bell Heard &rsquo;Round the World.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">Patterson Boulevard, on which Carillon Park is located, is one of
Dayton&rsquo;s busiest arteries of traffic. There are two reasons why it is
fitting to include this picture of teeming traffic with the story of the
self-starter. If the self-starter had not been invented, the automobile
would never have reached the place that it has in the lives of the people
of this country. Continued dependence on the old hand crank as a
means of starting would have been an almost unsurmountable handicap.
It is also interesting to know that many of the cars which contribute to
the stream of traffic on Patterson Boulevard are those of employees of
NCR and of General Motors. Deeds and Kettering started their business
careers with NCR and were responsible for bringing the first unit
of General Motors to Dayton.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
